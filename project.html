            <dt>HTML: Classwork on List and HyperLinks</dt>
            <dd><a href="https://siramin-dev.github.io/Frontendweek1/" target="_blank">Frontend Week1</a><br>This was my beginner class in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, we were asked to set up a Github profile, create a link to my <a href="https://siramin-dev.github.io/Frontendweek1/country.html" target="_blank">country.html</a> using the anchor element to perform a local document link within my <a href="https://siramin-dev.github.io/Frontendweek1/">index.html</a> directory listing the six geopolitical zone in nigeria, add a prolific image representing each zones giving a brief description of any state in each zone and an external link describing that zone. create another section using a descriptive list talking about three continents: Europe, America and Asia.
        Lastly, create an external link to <a href="https://univelcity.com/" target="_blank">Univelcity</a> that opens on a different tab. I was also thought the shortcut to create unordered and ordered list with a self document anchor element used to navigate to opening on my landing page.
        For example, <a href=https://siramin-dev.github.io/Frontendweek1/list.html#un>unordered list</a> and <a href="https://siramin-dev.github.io/Frontendweek1/list.html#or">ordered list</a> then add a mail <a href="mailto:sadiqalamin15727@gmail.com">send me a mail</a>, and <a href="tel:+2349065946565">call me</a> .</dl>

            <dd><a href="https://siramin-dev.github.io/Frontend_week3_6b7/">Frontend Week3</a><br> This was my first class on cascading style sheet and specificity. I learnt various ways of styling my web page which are; external, internal and inline styling.
        I learnt about specificity in details, styling different selectors such as <q>elements</q>, <q>class</q> and <q>Id</q>, I learnt how to style the parent or child selector, pseudo class selector where we have the adjacent selector and all siblings selector. e.g. first-of-child, nth-of-type and so on.
        I also learnt about colors and Background.</dd>
